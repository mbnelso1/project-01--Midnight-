## Pitch
Matt Haig’s The Midnight Library inspired this project, especially its idea that anyone can change. Real growth comes from choosing small, repeated actions that reshape who we become. In the game, each theater asks the player to make those small choices; collecting the Lightbulb, Heart, and Sword symbolizes becoming smarter, kinder, and braver. Borrowing from the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion, the design turns habit-building into play: little decisions add up, and the ending only opens once you’ve practiced all three qualities. 

## How to Play
- Click “Enter” on the landing page.
- Make choices to advance through levels. Each level completion rewards one token. Once all 3 are collected, you can exit. 
- NOTE: If you make the wrong choice, you will have to restart the level. 

## Tech
- HTML (multi-page)
- CSS (external stylesheets)
- JS to keep track of tokens and allow the player to leave once all tokens are collected. 

## Repo Layout
- `index.html` — landing & start
- `/game` — scenes, styles, scripts, assets
- `/docs` — `flowchart.png` or `.pdf`, notes
